# Advanced Calculator Design Document

## Overview:
The Advanced Calculator provides a user-friendly interface for performing various types of calculations. It supports basic arithmetic, scientific functions, unit conversions, and graph plotting. The calculator is responsive and can be used on various devices.

### System Design:
1. **Frontend**: HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.
2. **Backend**: Node.js for handling server-side functionality.
3. **Graphing**: D3.js/Plotly.js for graph plotting.
4. **Database**: MongoDB for storing history and memory.
5. **Testing**: Mocha and Chai for unit testing.

## Modules:
1. **Basic Arithmetic**: Handles basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. **Scientific Calculations**: Provides trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential calculations.
3. **Unit Conversion**: Converts values between different units (length, temperature).
4. **Graph Plotter**: Plots graphs for mathematical functions.
5. **Memory and History**: Allows users to store, recall, and clear previous calculations.
6. **Themes**: Supports toggling between light and dark themes for better accessibility.

### Flow:
- User inputs values -> Process via JS functions -> Display results -> History/Memory saved in MongoDB.
